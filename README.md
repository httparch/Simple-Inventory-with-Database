# ✨ Simple Inventory in Java ✨ 

##  A very simple inventory system written in java for our information management project. 🍍

This project is built to assess what we learn and apply basic queries and java database connectivity API. This was built with Eclipse IDE.
This project has 3 different source code:

* 'SplashScreen.java' - this is just an experimental loading background for the inventory system haha.
* 'adminPage.java' - this is for the log in page of the system.
*  'Inventory.java' - this is the main panel, where you can see the inventory interface.

## Inventory Walkthrough 🚶 
*Design and interface are created with java awt and swing

Make sure to run splash screen source code first haha.
